# Bash Starter Kit

Starter kit for a `bash` shell. Geared towards macOS. May not be fully
compatible with Linux, but at least some differences are considered. If
you attempt to use on Linux and encounter any issues, please submit a
pull request! Contributions for compatibility happily accepted.
Contributions for new features will also be considered.

## Usage

To use this repo, copy all of these files into your `$HOME` directory.

**IMPORTANT:** Before copying anything, be sure to check if any of these
files already exist, especially `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`. If so,
please consider a manual merge of these contents with your own so as not
to override any important settings you may already have.

## Assumptions

### Ruby

Assumed in here is that you may use `rbenv` and that you do not use
`rvm`. Files and paths are set from `$HOME/.rbenv` if it exists, and
`$GEM_HOME` is `unset`.
